_I've just made the Eventbrite page for the next event on February 18<sup>th</sup>, so [please go grab a ticket][1] if you're planning on coming._

----

Our first event feels like it was _ages_ ago now, and that's because it kind of _was_. We had to skip having an event in January as there was a couple of other events and hack days that clashed with me organising it, so our next event is [February 18<sup>th</sup> from 18:00][1].

I didn't get the chance to run the first event with much lead time, but this time there's a good 3 weeks before the event, so there's plenty of time to make sure you come down and check out what we're about.

And what is it that we're about _exactly_ I hear you ask? Well, it's a bit like a mini hack day that only lasts for 3 hours. We've got a big [Trello board full of ideas][2] and I'm keen to get stuck in with some of it.

I'm really excited about this event, and I hope you are too. Hopefully I'll see you in a few weeks.
