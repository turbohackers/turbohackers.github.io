So that's the first ever Turbo Hackers event done.

Around 12 of us met up at the DMC in Barnsley on a cold night in November and tried to organise ourselves into how we're going to work together in the future.

A first event like this is always hard, because we've got to first work out some projects. We spent a lot of time chatting about what projects we could work on together, and how we'd work on them together with each other. We settled on Trello, and our <a href="https://trello.com/b/a2CoupwM/projects">projects board is public</a>.

Some people asked me how I see this all working in the future. Should we all have to work on projects together, or can people come down and work on projects themselves? The truthful answer is I'm not sure. I don't see this all being as _my_ thing, I see it as being everybody's who comes down. All I'm doing is organising a room (and pizzas) for people.

I want anybody to come down who wants to work on their project with a bunch of other cool people. So whether they want to work on their own project, want to come down and just chat, or want to find projects they can get involved with, I want everybody to come down and get involved.

I hope everybody enjoyed what we're trying to do. There wasn't much hacking done in the first event, but I hope I can get everybody back next time to make some cool stuff.
