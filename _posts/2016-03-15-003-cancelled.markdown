_In short: I've had to cancel this month's event due to me being ill and not managing to organise things in time._

----

Sorry, I've had to cancel this month's event. I was hoping to get everything organised this week, but a combination of things has made that difficult (including me being ill).

I'm now going to start planning for next month's event. The biggest thing to organise is a worthy cause that we all want to make something for next month, so if you know one that you think would be suitable, let me know.
