Turbo Hackers are a bunch of coders, designers, thinkers and ideas people meeting once a month to work on projects together. We meet on the third Thursday of every month in Barnsley.

We sometimes work on projects together and sometimes people come down to work on projects by themselves, but to ask advice from other people.

We've got a [Trello board of all the current ideas][1]. We're an open group of people, so feel free to pop down whether you're new, experienced, or have no experience at all.

## Who and why?

Turbo Hackers is a brain child of [Craig Burgess][1]. That's the person writing this. Hello. I love going to hack days and wanted to have the opportunity to do them regularly, but not as intense. The idea behind Turbo Hackers is a mini hack day once a month, where we meet up and work on fun projects together.

Even though I organise the event, it isn't _my thing_. I don't see it like that. Whatever Turbo Hackers ends up being is the product of the local community, and I just pull people together. There's more about this in my [wrap up of the first event][2].

## Thank you
- [Tracey Johnson at Barnsley DMC for the venue every month][3]
- [Everybody at my design agency, Genius Division, for supporting the idea][4]
- [Matt and Kimb from Make Do for their support][5]
- [All the local agencies and others people who support us by turning up][6].
