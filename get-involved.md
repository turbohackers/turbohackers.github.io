If you're thinking about coming down to our next event, _please do_. There's no pressure to work on anything. Some people just turn up to chat, some people turn up to work on projects, and some people come for advice or ideas.

If you want to come and get involved with a group of designers, developers and tech people, just [pop down][2].

We've got a public [Trello board of all the current ideas][1]. If you feel like you've got something to contribute to this, or even if you just want to chat, come down to our next meet.
