We're a group of designers, developers, hackers, technologists, thinkers and doers that are _really_ passionate about helping worthy causes. At Turbo Hackers we like to get a charity, community organisation or any other worthy cause to suggest a current problem they're dealing with, and we'll try to tackle it.

## Some ways we could help

There's _loads_ of ways we could help and many are much more subtle than the ones below, but here's a general idea:

1. Ideas on how to raise awareness of events, causes, issues or problems.
2. Helping things look better (be it a website, brand, brochure, flyer, signage system).
3. Helping things to work better (be it a website, brand, brochure, flyer, signage system).
4. Helping to create a website, brand, flyer, brochure, signage solutions and many many other things.
5. Exploring how apps, websites or digital things could streamline particular parts of an organisation or workflow.
6. Seriously, there's loads of other things too.

## Our specific skills

Our specific skills in the group mainly revolve around technical, design and creative skills, but those skills span far and wide across many mediums. In short, most of the group do things like:

1. Make websites, mobile applications and web applications.
2. Make systems that digitise organisations.
3. Design graphics, logos, brands, stationery, brochures, posters etc.
4. Develop complex technical solutions for a wide variety of problems and challenges organisations face.

Our skillset really does vary wildly, and we think we can probably help you in some way.

## The process

Because we're a group that only gets together once a month for 3 hours, that does limit the extent to what we can help with on certain projects. Ideally we want to tackle smaller issues that we can provide solutions to relatively quickly, but we can work on things over several months. Obviously this all takes longer, so please don't come to us with urgent things.

1. We'll define the problem you're facing with you.
2. We'll put it to the group in an open session to discuss ideas, usually a month in advance.
3. Next month, we'll work on ideas on how we might be able to solve your problem.
4. We'll report the solution back to you, and you're free to use it how you see fit.
